# Publishing Forms

Forms behave much like regular WordPress posts and have two states: Draft and Published. When you create a new form, it will be in a Draft state. This means that it cannot be seen by anyone on your website. Website visitors can only see your form when it is published.

## Preview

To view your form click the Preview Preview button at the top of the page. WS Form will then show you how your form will look on your website. You can click the Preview button when the form is in Draft or Publish states.

## Publish

Once a form is published, WS Form creates a snapshot of your form at that moment. That snapshot is then used for the live view of your form on your website.
