# Use WS Form Variables to Build Dynamic WordPress Forms

> **Source**: [https://wsform.com/knowledgebase/variables/](https://wsform.com/knowledgebase/variables/)


WS Form variables enable you to add dynamic content to various elements of your form such as default field values and email templates.

Looking for some of our most commonly used variables? Check out our Variable Cheat Sheet!

Areas where WS Form variables can be used are accompanied by a field lookup  icon. By clicking this icon, a list of the available variables will be shown below the corresponding field. Clicking on a variable will insert it into the field you are editing.

All WS Form variables start with the # character. For example:

#blog_name

Some variables take additional parameters. For example:

#field(123)

If a variable takes more than one parameter, you separate those values with a comma. For example:

#email_submission(true,true,true)

If a variable parameter contains a comma, you should encase it in double quotes. For example:

#server_date_custom("d m, Y")
