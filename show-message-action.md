> **Source**: [https://wsform.com/knowledgebase/show-message/](https://wsform.com/knowledgebase/show-message/)

The Show Message action shows a message when a user saves or submits a form. The message can be positioned above or below the form. Messages have a variety of display options that can be configured when you add the action.

It is possible to add multiple message actions, so that messages are shown one after the other when the form is saved or submitted. You can drag and drop the actions to determine which order the messages are displayed in.

## Adding This Action

To add a Show Message action:

As with all sidebars in WS Form, click the Save button at the bottom to save your changes, or click Cancel to disregard your changes.

The Show a Messages action settings are as follows:

## When Should This Action Run?

You can choose to show the message when the form is saved, submitted, or both.

## Type

There are four different types of message:

## Content

Enter the message you would like to be displayed. HTML is supported in this field should you wish to apply additional formatting.

## Position

You can choose to position your message above or below your form when it fires. For large forms we would recommend enabling Scroll to top if you choose top positioning, so that the message is seen by the user.

## Hide Form When Shown

If enabled the form will be hidden when the message is shown.

## Clear Other Messages

If enabled any other messages on the screen will be cleared first. This is useful if you are adding multiple message actions.

## Scroll to Top

If enabled the browser will scroll to the top of the page when the message is shown.

## Show Duration

Use this field to enter how long the message is shown before the next action fires. The value entered should be in milliseconds (1 second = 1000 milliseconds). If you enter a value in this field, the following two options are also available.

## Hide Message After Duration

If enabled the message will be hidden after the Show Duration has elapsed.

## Show Form After Duration

If enable the form will be shown after the Show Duration has elapsed.
