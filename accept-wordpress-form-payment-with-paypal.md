# Accept WordPress Form Payment with PayPal

> **Source**: [https://wsform.com/knowledgebase/paypal_checkout/](https://wsform.com/knowledgebase/paypal_checkout/)


This knowledge base article relates to the WS Form PayPal Checkout add-on.
Included with the Freelance & Agency editions or buy separately for the personal edition.

The PayPal Checkout add-on allows you to accept PayPal or credit card payments from your forms. You can either charge a fixed amount using the button in isolation, or you can use the WS Form E-Commerce fields to produce more advanced cart options.

The PayPal Checkout button uses the latest client-side payment process offered by PayPal described here.

Note:Â When a PayPal Checkout transaction is completed, WS Form PRO will store the transaction ID with the form submission. This transaction ID is a credit transaction ID. Your customer will receive a debit transaction ID. Although these IDs are different, you can still search using either transaction ID in PayPal.

Note: You must serve the page containing the payment form over HTTPS. The address of the page containing PayPal Checkout must start with https:// rather than just http://.

## Installation

The WS Form PayPal Checkout add-on is installed in the same way as installing the WS Form PRO plugin.

Once installed you will need to activate the license for the plugin. When you purchase the PayPal Checkout add-on, you will be given a license key. If you have lost your license key(s), click here.

#### Amount To Charge

By default this field is blank, and the PayPal Checkout button will charge the amount calculated by the e-commerce fields on your form (the same as entering #ecommerce_cart_total).

You can also enter a fixed amount into this field.

#### Label

### Classes

For developers WS Form allows you to add your own classes to fields.

#### Field Wrapper

The wrapper CSS class setting enables you to add a class (or classes) to a field wrapper. Field wrappers are sections of HTML added around a field to position them on the page. To add multiple classes, add a space between the class names.

### Transaction

To map a field:

#### Zero Amount

You can configure how WS Form should handle zero amounts for PayPal Checkout buttons. In some cases you may wish to show an error message (e.g., a donation amount is set to zero). In other cases you may wish to still submit the form (e.g., if something is determined to be free). Select the appropriate action from the pull-down list.

#### Zero Amount Message

If you opt to show an error message, enter the error message you would like be shown here.

#### Messages

WS Form PRO processes any error messages as standard WS Form messages. The error message settings match those of the Show Message action. You can configure these settings to change how the error messages are displayed to users.

### Breakpoints

The breakpoint settings define the width of a field and also what the offset (how many columns from the left-hand side of the form or the previous field) of a field is for each breakpoint. For more information about the breakpoint settings and capabilities of WS Form, click here.
