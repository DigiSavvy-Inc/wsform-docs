# Learn More About the Anatomy of a Form

Each of your website pages can have one or many forms on it. Each form on a web page is known as a form instance. You can have as many form instances on a page as you need. For example, in addition to a contact us form, you could add a  newsletter sign-up form in the header and the footer of your website.

## Tabs

Tabs are a convenient way of splitting a form into separate pages.

Tabs are optional and forms can have one or many tabs. Forms with one tab are considered to be a single page form, and therefore the tab will not be show on your website.

When you create a new, blank form, it will only have one tab.  If you create an additional tab, WS Form will show the tabs at the top of your form on your website.

As a rule of thumb, smaller forms, such as a contact us form, are ideally suited to a single tab. Longer forms, such as an application form, might be better suited to a form with multiple tabs.

## Sections

Each tab can have one or more sections. You can think of a section as a logic grouping of fields. For example, you might have one section for personal information and another section for an address.

As a rule of thumb, smaller forms, such as a contact us form, might only need one section. More complex forms might benefit from multiple sections to provide a better layout of your fields.

## Fields

Each section can have one or many fields. There are over 55 different types of fields that you can add to your form, and each has its own settings that enable you to control how that field behaves.

## Actions

When a user completing a form clicks the Submit or Save button, you can set up any number of actions to run.

Each action takes the completed form fields and does something with them, such as sending an email to you, sending an email to the user, saving the form fields in WordPress, checking for spam, or showing a message on the web page to thank the user for their submission.

WS Form can be extended with Add-Ons to create additional actions, such as adding a contact to an external email marketing system such as AWeber, Mailchimp, or Constant Contact.

Actions can also be run by using conditional logic.

## Conditional Logic

This feature is available in WS Form PRO.

Conditional logic enables you to add interactivity to your form.

Examples uses of conditional logic are:

Each form can have one or more conditionals added to it. Each condition is made up of an IF, THEN, and ELSE.

IF: This is used to check one or more conditions, e.g., Does the field contain some text? If you add more than one condition, you can specify the logic between them, i.e.,  AND or OR.

THEN: If the IF condition is true, WS Form will run any defined actions, e.g., Show a field. You can add one or more THEN actions to run.

ELSE: If the IF condition is not true, WS Form will run the actions., e.g., Hide a field. You can add one or more ELSE actions to run.
