# Modula Add-OnPRO

The WS Form Modula add-on allows you show a Modula gallery on a form as well as being able to add, reorder and delete images in a gallery. When the form is submitted the Modula gallery will be updated to include any uploaded or deleted images as well as matching the order of the images.
