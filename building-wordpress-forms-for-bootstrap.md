Bootstrap is a popular, free and open-source CSS framework directed at responsive, mobile-first front-end web development. It contains CSS- and (optionally) JavaScript-based design templates for typography, forms, buttons, navigation, and other interface components. Many popular WordPress themes use Bootstrap.

If your WordPress theme uses the Bootstrap framework, WS Form can output forms that containÂ  HTML markup that is native to that framework. This means that WS Form physically changes the HTML so that your form dovetails seamlessly into your theme.

In addition to output native markup, WS Form will also change the breakpoint selector to match the available breakpoints in Bootstrap. This feature is only available in WS Form PRO.

All of the available WS Form field types are fully compatible with Bootstrap.
