> **Source**: [https://wsform.com/knowledgebase/use-repeatable-section-count-in-calculations/](https://wsform.com/knowledgebase/use-repeatable-section-count-in-calculations/)


The form example below demonstrates how to use a combination of the #calc field and #section_row_count variables to perform calculations on the number of rows in a repeatable section.
