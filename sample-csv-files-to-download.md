## How to Import CSV Files into WS Form

You can import these sample CSV files into a select, checkbox or radio field data grid in one of two ways:

### Preset Data Source

You can use the data source feature of a data grid to quickly and easily import the samples CSV files above.

Learn more about Data Sources.

### CSV Import

You can import any CSV file into a data grid. To import a CSV file, either click the Import  icon or drag a CSV file into the data grid area. When you drag the file into the data grid area, a blue box will appear with a dashed outline. Release the file into that area, and the CSV import will begin.

Note that when you import a file, all data in that data grid will be replaced with the CSV you import.
