> **Source**: [https://wsform.com/knowledgebase/wp-fusion/](https://wsform.com/knowledgebase/wp-fusion/)


WP Fusion synchronizes WS Form submissions with leading CRMs and marketing automation systems, keeps user profiles in sync with CRM contact records.

If you have the WP Fusion plugin installed you will find WP Fusion listed as an option when editing the actions of a form. This action will push the form submission to the CRM configured in WP Fusion.

## Configuring a Form for WP Fusion

It is possible to use any form created in WS Form and add an action so that it is submitted to WP Fusion when a user saves or submits their form.

To add a WP Fusion action:

As with all sidebars in WS Form, click the Save button at the bottom to save your changes, or click Cancel to disregard your changes.

## Settings

The WP Fusion action settings are as follows:

#### When Should This Action Run?

You can choose to run the WP Fusion action when the form is saved, submitted, or both.

### Opt-In Field

Use this setting to select which of your fields to act as the opt-in field. We recommend adding a checkbox field with a single checkbox. It is always recommended that you have an unchecked, opt-in checkbox on your forms to ensure you comply with GDPR requirements.

This field is option. If you do not select an opt-in field, all forms are pushed to WP Fusion.

### Add Only

When this setting is checked, WP Fusion will only add new contacts and will not update existing ones.

### Field Mapping

Field mapping tells WS Form which of your form fields relate to the corresponding fields in WP Fusion. For example, you would want to map your Email field to the Email field in WP Fusion.
